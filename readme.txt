Webanti is an anti-virus service that's analysing and detecting malware on websites & apps in real time.  

== Description ==
Webanti is an antivirus dedicated to websites. We're protecting them from malware, ransomware and backdoors.

Under Webanti's protection you will know that someone has hacked your website and installed malware.

Our advanced system scans every file that's hosted on server in search of malicious code.

We have rich database of virus definitions but as we know crackers like changes and they keep trying to hide malicious code every possible way. 

That's why we focused on creating most effective heuristic engine to detect every possible virus on server. 

Everyday our specialists collect and analyze fresh viruses that are not in our database and add their patterns to it.

Webanti is very effective even with most hidden malwares. Example of interesting infection which we had was described on our blog

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
1. Why do I need Webanti? 

Webanti isn't a next plugin that is vulnerable to security holes. Webanti is a SaaS service. It's not overloading the server of the internet application. 
We focus only on detecting and notifying you about ANY malicious code in files on your website. 
When you are under real-time protection then you recive e-mail alert about infection in 0.1 to 4 seconds after file is uploaded. It just depends of ISP bandwidth and e-mail provider speed. 

2. Is it effective?
YES IT IS! You don't need to trust our tests. Do the test by yourself. Run testing website and infect it by malware and then run our scanner. 

3. Why Webanti didn't find malware on my website?
By default we run scan with normal sensitiveness. It detects like 95% of malwares but sometimes they hide really good. 
We needed to reduce amout of false positive detections. If you want to detect all suspicious code then change sensitiveness and run scan on demend but keep in mind it will contain false positives.
